5 simple conceptual programs on list, dictionary and tuple


 Problem 1: Create a list of students, where each student is represented by a dictionary 
containing the student's ID, name, and grade. Write a function to add a new student to the list. 
Extend the function to check if a student with the same ID already exists and prevent duplicates. 


Problem 2: Create a dictionary to represent the inventory of a store, where the keys are item 
names and the values are tuples representing the price and available quantity. Write a function to 
update the quantity of an item after a sale. Modify the function to display an error message if the 
item does not exist in the inventory. 


Problem 3: Create a dictionary where the keys are patient IDs, and the values are dictionaries 
containing the patient’s name, age, and disease. Write a function to display the details of a 
patient when given the patient’s ID. Modify the function to return a patient’s data as a tuple 
instead of printing it. 


Problem 4: Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains a student name and their grade. 
Write a function that takes this list and calculates the average grade of the students. Modify the 
function to also return the highest and lowest grade along with the average. 


Problem 5: Create a module cinema_booking.py that manages movie bookings. Use a dictionary 
where the keys are movie titles and the values are the number of available seats. Write functions 
to book a seat, cancel a booking, and check the available seats. In a separate script, import the 
cinema_booking module and simulate booking a seat, canceling a booking, and checking the 
available seats.
